# Chrome Extension - Leads Tracker

This is a chrome extension build on scrimba's frontend developer path course.  

## Overview

To create a chrome extension that tracks leads and adds those leads to the UI as well as local Storage of the browser.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use localStorage, how to convert to JSON string and vise versa, template literals, and using a Chrome API.

```javascript
    let name = "Zaid";
    let templateStr = `This is a template literal by ${name}.`
```
```javascript
    // Convert to JSON
    let person = {
        name: "Zaid",
        age: 24
    }
    JSON.stringify(person);
```

### Continued development

I would like to build my knowledge on local storage vs session storage vs cookies. By learning the difference between each I will be able to know when to use/implement the best or most practical one.
